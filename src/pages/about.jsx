              Hmm... so you are here because you want to know about me, right?
              So let`s talk about me. My real name is Pranjal. In the year 2018,
              I was first introduced to hacking, and then I learned about
              programming and other technological concepts. My interest in
              technology was sparked by many people and watching YouTube. I
              learned the majority of what I know from YouTube, and then I
              learned how to do web research. And now I am a game developer, an
              AI developer, and a web developer. To know everything about me and
              my journey, see my blog{" "}
