# Hmm... lets start

My real name is Pranjal, and my nickname is Ishank. In the year 2018, I was exposed to hacking and coding. That was one of my friends in grade 7th, and he was like a hacker-thinggy. I thought that I could also do those things.
\
\
Then I started learning **Java**. But, sooner or later, I realised that in order to hack, I needed to learn programming, so I began learning **HTML** and **CSS**.
\
\
I made [My first website](https://bigbeastishank.github.io/Website-first-try/) (this was not actually my first website, but it was actually my first website on which I worked perfectly. I have used many templates as websites, and this was also a part of them. This is only left in records because when this website was made, I changed my hosting from that random site to GitHub.). Then I hosted it on some platform I don't remember. Till this time, I used to make gameplay videos on YouTube, so I thought of making a discord server. I was not popular enough, but I still made it.
\
\
I meet my friend **[Kushagra Raj](https://kushagraraj.me)** he said that he would help me build my Discord server because I was totally new to Discord, so he helped me make it. Then he added his discoord bot, which has been saddly discontinued due to some reason. I was shocked that we could make a bot that would work on that platform, so I asked him how to make it. He said we could make it in JavaScript, so I started learning JavaScript. I also came to know that he made websites, and we were in a friendly battle of making websites. We copied many websites from the bootstrap template. Then I got a bit off from making websites and started making my discord bot. [BEAST BOT](https://top.gg/bot/709984874924081174). Then I made a server for it on my own. If you want to join, you can find the link in **footer**.
\
\
After completing my bot, I was distracted by game development. I learned a lot of new things as well as a new language, **C # in unity**. I followed many youtube tutorials and then made my first (copied) game, Beast Doge. It was a clone of [Brackey](https://youtube.com/c/Brackeys)'s Doge Game, but I added my UI. I published it but then removed it because of copyright issues. I made another **OG** game. **[Beast Race](https://github.com/BIGBEASTISHANK/Beast-Race)** and this was the first game where I actually learned something in game development. Then I uploaded this game at my first website.
\
\
After uploading my game, I told Bruce (which is the nick name of Kushagra) to collab with me and make a website, and I would make a game. We started, but that didn't wake him up because he was already working on his bot. But at the time, he stated that we would create a website using **React**, so as you are all aware, I do everything that I see, so I started learning to react. Then I made a [website again](https://github.com/bigbeastishank/bigbeastishank-react-website-sc) but that is shut down for many reasons.
\
\
I started my journey in AI development as my [fuffa ji (uncle)](https://twitter.com/sinrkb) game project. He is **Co-Chairman and CEO of [EST Group and the global headquarter of his enterprise](https://www.estglobalinc.com/) which is located at CIC-MIT, USA**. For my AI, I began using **python**. I successfully completed it, and then they told me to make a website. which is private. I was half way through, but due to exams and all that, I stopped working on that project and never started again. But I have completed the login page. I made that website in Python, so I got familiar with Python web development. I started another Python project with **My Sql** as the backend but abandoned it because I did not have enough resources to host a fully functional Python backend website. But I made a personal [python website](https://bigbeastishank.herokuapp.com) which became a project, before making this website and after making my first react website that was my official website.
\
\
Before taking a break, Bruce made a website for his Discord bot. Which was made on [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), I also tried to make my prsonal website but faield because I was not having enough knowladge od javascript

## In a long break....

I started [fiverr](/fiverr). My gig was to make websites for others, but it didn't succeed. I got only one client, and he is my friend [Himanshu Shekhar](https://www.instagram.com/himanxhhu/).
\
\
In this long break, I left the IT field as everyone needs a break and I took my break due to studies and all that stuff, but my BFFs **[Divya Rani Soni](https://instagram.com/divyarani9464)** and **[Sahil Singh Rajput](https://www.instagram.com/_sahil__singh__rajput_/)** encouraged me again towards the IT field.
\
\
In this break I downloaded Parrot OS as my main OS.

## After a long break....

I took a break from coding after **Fiverr** and came on **Hacking**. I switched from Windows to Linux. After sticking to **[Parrot Linux](https://parrotsec.org)** for about 1 month, I started distro hoping and I came across **[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)**. I used some window manager like **[Xmonad](https://github.com/BIGBEASTISHANK/xmonad-dotfiles-1.0)**, **[Qtile](https://github.com/BIGBEASTISHANK/qtile-dotfiles-3.0)** (this was the WM on which I stayed longest), **[BSPWM](https://github.com/BIGBEASTISHANK/bspwm-dotfiles-1.0)**. By clicking on the name of WM, you can see my configuration. Then I switched to GNOME, which does not require any configuration.
\
\
Around October 2021, I saw Bruce's **main** website and it was made on [Next Js](https://nextjs.org). heard about NextJS when I made my react website, but I ignored it because I didn't want to make a website and **I left coding** like 4-5 months ago. Suddenly, from somewhere, I started coding again in December. I started working on this website. This website is made on **Next Js** customised on **Chakra-Ui** and hosted on **Vercel**. **[Tanmay Sinha](https://github.com/tanmaysinha14)** helped me a lot in the design of this website. He is a **UI Desiginer**.
\
\
I previously used to learn from **YouTube** (till my React website), but now I learn from **documentation** and **articles**. Youtube surely helps, but as we are teenagers, we just get distracted, so we skip the learning part from YouTube and just copy the codes. We call them [Script kiddie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie), and I admit I was also a script kiddie, but I learned from my mistakes and switched to docs and articles. In those, you learn more than just how to be a script kiddie. If coding is just your passion, then learn from YouTube (I did that for like two and a half years), but if you want to make a career in programming, learn from **documentation** and **articles** and then take help from **YouTube** when you get stuck in the middle or don't know where to go from that point. I still use YouTube to get a quick start on a new project, then I start reading docs. Directly reading docs is like diving into water without knowing how to swim. I hope you understand.
