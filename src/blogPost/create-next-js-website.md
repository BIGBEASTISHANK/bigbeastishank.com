# First let's talk about "What is NextJs?"

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is a framework and it is based on React. It is much better than React because it has much better performance, better SEO results, a dynamic page system, etc.

## How is server-side rendering faster than client-side rendering?

In server-side rendering the contents of the webpage, be it HTML, CSS or Javascript are generated on the server, and the whole HTML page is downloaded and displayed. So, all the pre-processing, calculations, and any complex communication with the server are handled in the server itself whereas, in client-side rendering, everything is processed at clientside

# Advantages of NextJs over React

1. **It's super fast**
   \
   With the help of Server-side rendering and static-site generation loads the site blazing fast.

2. **It's SEO friendly.**
   \
   Server-side rendering fuels our goals to achieve levels of SEO, UX, performance, etc. Moreover, you can customize your own `<meta>` tags to improve your Search Engine Optimisation to your liking by importing Head from `"next/head"` and these meta tags will be appended to your page so that search engines could crawl swiftly. How cool is that!

3. **Wide features out of the box**
   \
   Minifying javascript, doing code splitting, lazy loading, prefetching assets, render the minimal amount of HTML, caching builds, all performance optimization comes out of the box, in nextJs so your primary focus remains the development of your project.
