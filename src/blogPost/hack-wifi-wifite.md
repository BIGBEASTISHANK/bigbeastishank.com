# # What is wifite?

Wifite is a popular automated wireless network auditing tool that is used for auditing and cracking the wireless networks. It is designed to perform automated attacks on wireless networks with the intention of discovering weak security configurations or vulnerabilities. The tool is open-source and runs on the Linux operating system.
\
\
Wifite uses various methods such as WPA/WPA2, WEP, and WPS to crack the wireless network's security. It can automate the process of capturing packets, analyzing them, and testing different password combinations until the correct one is found. The tool can also detect and de-authenticate connected clients to the network, which forces them to re-authenticate and provide their password credentials.

It is important to note that using Wifite or any other wireless network auditing tool on a network without the owner's permission is illegal and unethical. It is recommended to use such tools only for educational or authorized security testing purposes.
