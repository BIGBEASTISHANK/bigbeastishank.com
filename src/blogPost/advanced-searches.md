# # Start

1. You can search within a particular URL by including the operator `site:example.com` before or after your keywords. Extremely helpful to search on programming websites that do not have a search functionality.

2. If you’re looking for an exact phrase, use quotation marks around the keywords to view results containing that exact phrase.

3. If your search terms contain a keyword with several meanings, you can exclude one of the meanings by adding a hyphen (-) before the keyword.

4. Google omits most non-alphanumeric characters from its queries. Symbols that programmers use all the time like !@#$%^& and \* aren’t searched. Neither are (){}[]. Fortunately, DuckDuckGo recently started supporting all characters in searches. So consider using DuckDuckGo for your more sophisticated searches. They really are the most programmer-friendly search engine.

5. To generate content similar to those found on a URL you already know, use the `related:` operator before adding the URL.

6. You can retrieve pages whose titles contain the keywords you’re searching for, by using the `allintitle:` operator.

7. To retrieve pages where all the keywords appear in the body of the page, use the `allintext:` operator before the search terms.

8. You can enter more than one query into Google at a time to view pages with one of the specified keywords. Just use a capitalised “OR” to separate the terms.

9. To look for news items emerging from a particular location, use the `location:` operator, then add the city name.

10. An asterisk acts as a wildcard to help you find the missing word in a phrase.

11. Using the `link:` operator, you can find pages that link to another url. This is probably more useful for SEOs who are searching for backlinks to a specific page.

12. If you’re looking for a specific file on the Web, you can use the `filetype:` operator to specify the particular document type you’re searching for, and Google will restrict results to pages containing those document types.

13. If you’re looking for a specific file on the Web, you can use the filetype: operator to specify the particular document type you’re searching for, and Google will restrict results to pages containing those document types.
