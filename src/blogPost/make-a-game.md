# How to start??

To make a game, you need a game engine, so it can do all the boring stuff like setting lights, doing mathematical calculations, etc at the back while you can do all the good stuff like scripting, changing game objects, making game UI, etc.

### Game Engines!

### 1 Popular Game Engines

- [Unity](https://unity.com/download)
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
- [Cosco 2D](http://www.cocos2d.org/)
- [Cry Engine](https://www.cryengine.com/)

### 2 What we are going to use??

- [Unity](https://unity.com/download)

# Steps

1. Install Unity hub from their website.
   ![unity download](/img/blog/make-a-game/unity-download.webp)

   For Linux:

   Arch

   `$ sudo pacman -S unityhub`
   \
   \
   Debian

   `$ sudo apt install ubuntu-unity-desktop `
   \
   \
   \
   **Note: I am using latest _Unity Hub 3.0_ for this blog**

2. Make a account and get a free personal license for unity engine.
   ![get license1](/img/blog/make-a-game/get-license-1.webp)
   ![get license2](/img/blog/make-a-game/get-license-2.webp)
   ![get license3](/img/blog/make-a-game/get-license-3.webp)
   ![get license4](/img/blog/make-a-game/get-license-4.webp)
   ![get license5](/img/blog/make-a-game/get-license-5.webp)

3. Download Unity Engine.
   ![install unity engine1](/img/blog/make-a-game/install-unity-engine-1.webp)
   ![install unity engine2](/img/blog/make-a-game/install-unity-engine-2.webp)

   **Note: I prefer to download LTS version as it has long term support**

4. Make a project.
   ![make project1](/img/blog/make-a-game/make-project-1.webp)
   ![make project2](/img/blog/make-a-game/make-project-2.webp)

5. Editor will open, now make your first game.
   ![unity editor](/img/blog/make-a-game/unity-editor.webp)

### Note: This is simple tutorial on how to make game and not on how to use unity editor, so I am not going to explain unity UI and scripting.
