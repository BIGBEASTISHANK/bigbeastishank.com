# How we become a script kiddie??

When we start entering the programming world, we look up at YouTube tutorials and follow each and every single step that is shown in the video. By doing this, we do the work and then forget it. It is because new generetions need results really quickly. I won't lie, I am also like that, but if we need to become programmers, we need to learn things, not just do things.

## What are demerits of just using youtube??

When we search for some tutorial on youtube and follow it step by step, it won't help us a lot. Because of our subconcious mind, we simply copy and paste things without understanding. You just need to show people that you know stuff, but in reality you don't. Youtube will be helpful if you do it slow and stady and not picking up the speed of a rocket while being a beginner.

## How do I learn from my mistake??

So here I am going to tell you all the truth about how I learned from my mistake. I used templates and just modified them, or you can call it editing them and calling myself a programmer, which is false. I watch YouTube tutorials and copy them verbatim, then edit some things. After a week or so, if I want to work on my own project at that time, I have no clue where to start. It is because in the first week, I became a script kiddie. I know how to do stuff but don't exactly know how it works, and believe me, this happens to almost every new comer in this field. And this is very bad.

## What should you do first??

Here is some advice from my side on what you should do first. It is not necessary that it should be a website to create a to-do-list. It could be anything, but the best way I know is through a website, to be more specific, [Todoist](https://todoist.com). It's because it has a dark theme, which is essential for programmers, and it's also very simple and free. Now the first thing you should choose is which category of programmer you want to be, like a web developer, a game developer, etc. Now you need to learn the basics of that thing and then you need to create many small projects. These small projects are your lessons. When you do lessons regularly, you remember all the small and important things. Don't forget to add the things you want to do in that project to the todo-list, like researching, creating a navbar, creating a footer, etc. Planning is very, very important to becoming a good programmer.

## How to research??

For research, you can use Google, you can read blogs like you are reading this, you can read articles, etc. You can also watch some YouTube tutorials because there is some stuff that is definitely going to go over your head in blogs and articles, so you need a video guide. By doing this and creating small projects, you are going to reduce the use of blogs, articles, and YouTube and remember stuff so you can do it in feature projects.

## Result!!!

If you followed all the steps I told you, then you can say proudly that you are a good programmer. You're still skeptical? listen, when you earlies start a new project, you don't know what to do, but you've already done many projects of different kinds and now you know how things work, so now you know where to start that project, how to create a to-do list, and how to work. It is very simple, but sometimes people need a guide and this blog was that. You are going to be a real programmer after this blog, so there is no need to search for anything now. Follow the steps I told you and start a new journal now.
