# Hmm... lets start

My real name is Pranjal and my nick name is Ishank. I year 2018 I as exposed to hacking and coding. Their was one of my friend in grade 7th and he was like hacker thinggy. I thought that I can also do those things.
\
\
Then I started learning **Java**. But sooner I realised in hacking I need to learn programming so at that movenment I started learning **HTML, CSS**
\
\
I made [My first website](https://bigbeastishank.github.io/Website-first-try/) (this was not actually my first website it was actually my first website on which I worked perfectly, I have used many template as a website and this was also a part of them, and this is only left in records because when this website was made I changed my hosting from that random site to GitHub). Then I hosted it on some platform I dont remember. Till this time I use to make gameplay videos on youtube so I thought of making a discord server. I was not popular enough but still I made it.
\
\
I meet my friend **[Kushagra Raj](https://kushagraraj.me)** he said that he will help me build my discord server because I was totally noob discord so he helped me make it. Then se added his discoord bot, which is saddly discontinued due to some reasoon. I was shoked that we can make a bot which will work on that platform so I asked he how to make it. He said we can make it on JavaScript so I started learniing javaa script. I also came to now that he make website then we were in friendly battle of making websites. We copied many websites from bootstrap template. Then I got a bit off from making websites and started making my discord bot [BEAST BOT](https://top.gg/bot/709984874924081174). Then I made a server for it on my own. If you want to join you can find link in **footer**.
\
\
After completing my bot, I was distracted to wards game development. I learned many things and a new language **C# in unity** I followed many youtube tutorial and then made my first (copied game) Beast Doge. It was clone of brackey's doge game but I added my UI. I published it but then removed because of copyright issues. I made one more **OG** game **[Beast Race](https://github.com/BIGBEASTISHANK/Beast-Race)** and this was the first game where I actually learned something in game development. Then I uploaded this game at my first website.
\
\
After uploading my game, I said Bruce (which is the nick name of Kushagra) to collab and make a website and I will make game. We started but that didn't wokedout because he was already working on his bot. But in that time he said that we will make website on **React** so as you all know till now. I do everything what I see so I started learning react then I made a [website again](https://github.com/bigbeastishank.github.io) but that is shutted down due to many reasons.
\
\
I started my journey in AI development as my [fuffa ji (uncle)](https://twitter.com/sinrkb) game project. He is **Co-Chairman and CEO of [EST Group and the global headquarter of his enterprise](https://www.estglobalinc.com/) which is located at CIC-MIT, USA**. I started doing **python** for my AI. I sucessfully completed it and then they game me to make a website. Which is private. I was half way through but due to exams and all those I stoped working on that project and never started again. But I have completed login page, I made that website on python so I got familiar to python web development. I started one more project on python with **My Sql** as backend but left it I was not having enough resources to host a fully functional backend website made on python. But I made a [python website](https://bigbeastishank.herokuapp.com) which became a project, before making this website and after making my first react website that was my official website.

## After a long break....

In this long break I left IT field as everyone needs a break and I took my break due to studies and all those stuffs but my BFFs **[Divya Rani Soni](https://instagram.com/divyarani9464)** and **[Sahil Singh Rajput](https://www.instagram.com/_sahil__singh__rajput_/)** encouraged me again towards IT field
\
\
I started [fiverr](https://fiverr.com/bigbeastishank). My gig was of making website for others, but it didn't succeded. I got my only client and he is my friend only [Himanshu Sekhar](https://www.instagram.com/himanxhhu/).
\
\
I took a break from coding after **fiverr** and came on **hacking**. I switched from windows to linux. After sticking to **[Parrot Linux](https://parrotsec.org)** for about 1 month, I started distro hoping and I came across **[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)**. I used some window manager like **[Xmonad](https://github.com/BIGBEASTISHANK/xmonad-dotfiles-1.0)**, **[Qtile](https://github.com/BIGBEASTISHANK/qtile-dotfiles-3.0)** (this was the WM on which I stayed longest), **[BSPWM](https://github.com/BIGBEASTISHANK/bspwm-dotfiles-1.0)**. By clicking on the name of WM you can see my configuration. Then I switched to gnome, which does not required any configuration.
\
\
Around october 2021 I saw Bruce **main** website and it was made on [Next Js](https://nextjs.org). I have heard about next js when I made my react website but I ignored it because I don't wanted to make a website and **I left coding** for like 4-5 months ago. Suddenly from somewhere I started coding again in December end. I started working on this website. This website is made on **Next Js** customised on **Chakra-Ui** and hosted on **Vercel**. **[Tanmay Sinha](https://github.com/tanmaysinha14)** helped me a lot in design of this website. He is a **UI Desiginer**.
