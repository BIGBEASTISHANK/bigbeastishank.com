5. Select number of messages to send. In your case then max number limit would be `500`, I have modded it so I am getting `10000000`.

6. Enter the time (in seconds) to send next message. I usually use `1`.

7. Now it will ask for thread to use, skip this part, just enter the recommended number.

8. Click `Enter`

9. Bombing will start when you clicked enter.

## Note

While bombing you will see `Target's` number, total number of messages sended till now, total number of messages received and total number of messages failed to send.
