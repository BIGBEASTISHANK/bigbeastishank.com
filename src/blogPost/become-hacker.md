# ## C|EH Cources Information

### 1) CEH Course Eligibility:

There are two paths that applicants can choose from to be eligible for the final C|EH exam.
\
The first is to attend an official EC-Council training course, which is designed for all skill levels.
\
The training course does not require previous cybersecurity experience.
\
\
The second path allows applicants with at least 2 years of previous information security experience to skip
the course and go directly to taking the certification exam. Applicants must first submit evidence of their previous
experience and should have knowledge in the following fields:

* Information security and ethical hacking
* Reconnaissance techniques
* System hacking phases and attack techniques
* Network and perimeter hacking
* Web application hacking
* Wireless network hacking
* Mobile platform, IoT, and operational technology (OT) hacking
* Cloud computing
* Cryptography

### 2) Course Duration:
EC-Council has designed this course as a bootcamp to accelerate your journey to becoming a C|EH.
\
The 5-day, 40-hour program is designed to maximize learning and get you ready for action as soon as possible.
\
\
At the end of the course, you'll need to pass a 4-hour exam composed of multiple-choice questions that test what you have learned.
\
Once you pass the C|EH exam, you'll have the opportunity to continue sharpening your ethical hacking skills and achieve further recognition
in the field of ethical hacking with the C|EH (Master) credential.

### 3) The Certified Ethical Hacker (Master) Credential:
The C|EH (Master) certification is the next step for top C|EHs.
\
Those who earn the C|EH (Master) credential have proven their proficiency, confidence, and in-depth comprehension
of ethical hacking through their outstanding performance on the 6-hour C|EH (Practical), a rigorous, hands-on exam in a
live network environment that challenges participants to put their knowledge to the test.
\
\
The C|EH (Master) credential proves to current and future employers that the holder's information security abilities are of the highest caliber.
\
While there are no specific eligibility criteria for the C|EH (Practical), candidates are strongly recommended to first take the C|EH course.
\
In order to earn the C|EH (Master) certification, participants must pass both the C|EH certification exam and the C|EH (Practical).
